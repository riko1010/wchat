    This function streams the rows of the CSV file as dictionaries. The keys of

    ----------

    encoding : str

    num_chars : int

        Note that using less than the entire file will speed up detection, but

    Returns
    -------
    rows: generator
        Returns file as a generator over rows as dictionaries.
