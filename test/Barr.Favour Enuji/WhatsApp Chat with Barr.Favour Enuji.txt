8/6/23, 2:31 PM - W: You should check the links out in addition to the documents. It's very detailed. Those concerns about Kalikwu actions and others are presented with evidence showing I'm not wanting. These recent events and evidences are also presented.
8/7/23, 5:43 PM - W: I did not receive call notices from you. Akpati notified you have engaged Barr.Agholor. I'm expecting feedback. You can call or write.
8/8/23, 10:33 AM - W: My brother will call and meet you at your office today.
8/8/23, 12:06 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: Okay. That's ok
8/8/23, 12:07 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: Meanwhile, just seeing this message now.

Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday. I was busy perusing and understanding the documents you sent
8/8/23, 12:07 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: Particularly this. It contains new aspects of the case, of which I'm just getting insights. It's a comprehensive one though
8/8/23, 12:07 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: And yes, I've had a conference with Barrister and I've been well informed on the needed steps for the possible withdrawal
8/8/23, 12:07 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: I'm still in Court and wouldn't know when I'd be chances to be with your brother. So our meeting may not be possible today
8/8/23, 12:07 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: As for timeline, the procedure will span the period of the High Court Vacation which just commenced this week. 

The procedure would involve a Senior  influential Lawyer, his juniors, the officials of the prison,
8/8/23, 12:12 PM - W: I've asked a withdrawal be issued. The prison in-charge encouraged consulting a SAN in Asaba, I'll not be doing that.
8/8/23, 12:12 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: Can I call you now?
8/8/23, 12:13 PM - W: The prison in charge received 1.2 million naira for an investigation, 2m naira for closure after investigation which I forfeited after he refused to honour the notice I'd leave after paying the 2m. I've donated 11m to the judiciary with notice to the Chief Judge.
8/8/23, 12:13 PM - W: I'll not be consulting a lawyer per the prison's In-Charge directive.
8/8/23, 12:13 PM - W: I have a senior advocate, Sani Katu SAN involved in this matter.
8/8/23, 12:14 PM - W: This statement was given at his instigation.
8/8/23, 12:14 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: I don't know the Prison officer in charge neither have I met with him
8/8/23, 12:14 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: Okay. Seen
8/8/23, 12:14 PM - W: The lawyer at Asaba was suggested by the prison on charge and Barr.agholor.
8/8/23, 12:14 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: Okay
8/8/23, 12:15 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: His name?
8/8/23, 12:15 PM - W: I told them I'll engage my own lawyers not theirs given he did not uphold the agreement after paying.
8/8/23, 12:15 PM - W: I did not enquire about their recommended lawyer, my own lawyers was indicated to be able to workout a withdrawal action.
8/8/23, 12:16 PM - W: It'd be unwise to me to engage a lawyer recommended by the prison in charge for a withdrawal when I'm paying 5m to the accusers.
8/8/23, 12:16 PM - W: It's additional financial commitment and to me, not necessary for a withdrawal.
8/9/23, 6:28 PM - W: Barr.Enuji.
I spoke to Akpati, he stated the lawyer at Asaba is supporting Barr.Agholors efforts. He said his involvement is free of charge and Barr.Agholor recommends his inclusion given they both handled the withdrawal efforts. Is this true ?.
8/9/23, 6:29 PM - W: I'm waiting for confirmation of the arrangements if feasible so I'm out of here asap.
8/9/23, 6:29 PM - W: Good evening.
8/16/23, 6:02 PM - W: I called. Let me know when you're available. I'll call back.
8/21/23, 6:26 PM - W: Can you handle this issue ?. Last year you claimed Kalikwu was reason for being unable to attend. What is the concern this year ?. I've tried to reach you after discussions with Agholor recently. You're incommunicado.
8/21/23, 8:58 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: Good day 

Yeah, I've been somewhat incommunicado as I had a health situation for much of last week. Meanwhile, after meeting with Agholor, I'm convinced that his capacity and desire to secure your bail is not in issue. The idea of cutting the cost for the procedure is something not feasible according to him, as contingencies may arise.
8/21/23, 9:05 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: On withdrawal, he's of the view that with you out of the gulag, the interests will wane and a withdrawal would be the next logical move. The more you stay incarcerated, the more intense the case gets.
8/21/23, 9:10 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: Last year, Kalikwu was not the drawback but personal reasons and commitments which I believed may cog the progress of the case. By the way, what made the Court refuse the bail application by Kalikwu?
8/22/23, 1:57 AM - W: The court has not refused any of my bail application. If you can handle this then you should be available or I'll look for someone else.
8/22/23, 1:58 AM - W: I'll be petitioning and defending asap. I engage you for specific services if you can't handle them then notify Barr.agholor you're not vested in the matter.
8/22/23, 1:58 AM - W: I'm not asking for a withdrawal without evidence of me being the victim. You have had weeks to handle this issue. You've not done anything or be available to my knowledge.
8/22/23, 1:59 AM - W: Speedy recovery, the expectation is they issue a withdrawal on receipt of 5m they requested. I'll not be paying if it's not a feasible arrangement.
8/22/23, 3:35 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: I am kindly opting out. I will be communicating my decision with Barrister Agholor. I honestly feel I shouldn't be a cog in the wheel or reason for any delayed expectations. You may wish to engage some other Counsel.
8/22/23, 3:36 PM - Barr.Favour Enuji: I'll notify Agholor on this
8/22/23, 4:45 PM - W: I asked you opt out if you can't handle it. Speedy recovery. For arguments sake I share most conversations regarding this matter.
