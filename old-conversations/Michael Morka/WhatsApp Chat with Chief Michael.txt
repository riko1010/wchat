5/31/22, 1:48 PM - W: It takes time and investigation to get there

5/31/22, 1:48 PM - Chief Michael: But this report requires immediate identification and arrest

5/31/22, 1:48 PM - Chief Michael: Your lawyer was present

5/31/22, 1:48 PM - Chief Michael: Confirm from him also

5/31/22, 1:48 PM - W: It will be after the investigation before that

5/31/22, 1:49 PM - Chief Michael: We can't teach the police their job my son, they told me  it requires immediate identification and arrest.

5/31/22, 1:49 PM - W: No

5/31/22, 1:50 PM - Chief Michael: If it was possible I would have brought good news to you when I came to visit

5/31/22, 1:51 PM - Chief Michael: I was at the police station and when the statement was to be made they told me it would be impossible to do so

5/31/22, 1:51 PM - W: What kind of thing is this

5/31/22, 1:51 PM - W: I know the way things are. Its a complaint for all sakes

5/31/22, 1:51 PM - W: What are you doing ?

5/31/22, 1:52 PM - W: I am the one who can give details on who the armed men are, after the complaint during the investigation, we will get there

5/31/22, 1:52 PM - W: Daddy stop now,

5/31/22, 1:53 PM - Chief Michael: My son, if it was possible I would've made the report already. I went there myself with okafor,  welder and your lawyer .

5/31/22, 1:53 PM - W: Daddy what are you saying

5/31/22, 1:53 PM - Chief Michael: Then why not be patient until you're out ?

5/31/22, 1:53 PM - W: Do u know that police headquarters can fire people foe refusing such a critical report ?

5/31/22, 1:53 PM - Chief Michael: Because they refused to let me make the report

5/31/22, 1:53 PM - W: They cannot do that

5/31/22, 1:54 PM - W: They have to take your report here in Agbor and take the statements of the witnesses.

5/31/22, 1:55 PM - W: Its just a complaint here before going to asaba

5/31/22, 1:55 PM - Chief Michael: It would've been possible if you're present because you're the complainant but it's not possible my son

5/31/22, 1:55 PM - Chief Michael: They refused to let me make the report my son, what can I do ?

5/31/22, 1:55 PM - W: Daddy if someone is threatening and has made attempts to kill your son, you can report it anywhere

5/31/22, 1:56 PM - W: You de let them deceive you ?

5/31/22, 1:56 PM - W: Or you choose to support then

5/31/22, 1:57 PM - Chief Michael: My son I am not joking with this matter, if they won't let me make the report, do I force the police ? Or is there anyone I can meet for assistance since I'm not getting any to help in that aspect?

5/31/22, 1:57 PM - Chief Michael: I am not supporting them my son

5/31/22, 1:57 PM - W: Daddy what are u doing now

5/31/22, 1:58 PM - W: Its illegal for u to do this

5/31/22, 1:58 PM - Chief Michael: I'm not at rest because of this matter, how can I be in support of people trying to harm my own son?
