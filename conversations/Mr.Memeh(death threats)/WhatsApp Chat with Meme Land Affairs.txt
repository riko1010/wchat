3/21/22, 7:49 PM - Meme Land Affairs: Though, I have seen the uploaded tellers.

3/21/22, 7:50 PM - W: Ok

4/6/22, 1:39 AM - W: Today makes it 2 weeks and some days, i am proceeding with  development. Nice doing business with you. Any and all effects on the land are now property of the owner being me, if any advise let me know but shouldn't be regarding the cassava leaves.

4/6/22, 6:05 AM - Meme Land Affairs: Noted, remember that it takes somebody who is alive and healthy to build a house. Some built, but others lived. Learn from the experience of others, where is Chief Orikeze and all his money.? Do whatever thing u want, u will look for me.

4/6/22, 12:07 PM - W: You are not very intelligent. I will look for you to explain this stupid statement.

4/11/22, 8:42 AM - W: I am back in Agbor.

In light of your tolerance before i purchased the land and the friendliness of your brother. I am providing this explanation and options.

4/11/22, 8:44 AM - W: First, i made small modifications to the land to allow for the fencing, this affected less than 5 percent of the total land area, this modification would see me give you a small amount of money to compensate for the lost crops in the fencing line, something like 10% of the total 100k you proposed as the value of the farm.

4/11/22, 8:44 AM - W: The crops aside from the 5% modification to allow fencing are all in tact and in good health.

4/11/22, 8:44 AM - W: I gave you 2 weeks for harvest which is sufficient time, its past the two weeks. Today you have several options.

4/11/22, 8:45 AM - W: One is to come so we discuss and that discussion would require you to start harvesting today.

4/11/22, 8:45 AM - W: The second is to tell me why you are unable to harvest it within the two weeks i gave, your explanation would determine my actions.

4/11/22, 8:46 AM - W: The third is that you choose to disregard my effort to conclude this in a friendly manner, that would mean me being at liberty to take decisions in line with my best interests.

4/12/22, 1:35 PM - W: IMG-20220412-WA0009.jpg (file attached)

4/12/22, 3:11 PM - Meme Land Affairs: Thanks and God bless, you can remove the cassava, my regards,

4/12/22, 3:16 PM - W: It would cost me money to do that, would have been effective for you to harvest it since u already have customers or a means to utilize them.

4/12/22, 3:16 PM - W: No worries, nice doing business.

4/12/22, 3:42 PM - Meme Land Affairs: My wife is in jos for ANAN exam, hence the agreement with your mother for 2 months when she will be around. U were too good to me, I didn't forget your generosity to me in two occasions.l was only angry with the position of Samuel on settlement who was not comfortable with my settlement of 100k. His approach was unfriendly. However, am sorry for our little misunderstanding, That land will give you peace, forgive my wrongs if any, but for cassava, we are indisposed, my regards.

4/12/22, 10:25 PM - W: Understood.
