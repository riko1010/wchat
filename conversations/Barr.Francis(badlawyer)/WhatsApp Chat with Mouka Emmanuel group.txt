7/4/23, 7:45 AM - P.D: Goodmorning everyone

7/4/23, 7:45 AM - P.D: @2348038071872  I guess from tomorrow work starts as planned or any new development

7/4/23, 7:46 AM - Barr Francis: Yes. Definitely. I've spoken with the IPO and the complainant's lawyer. We'd be meeting tomorrow at Asaba.

7/4/23, 7:46 AM - Barr Francis: Good morning all

7/4/23, 7:49 AM - P.D: 👍👍

7/4/23, 7:52 AM - Barr Francis: I'll also go to the ministry of Justice to meet with the lawyer handling the matter.

7/4/23, 12:40 PM - W: I just met the lawyer to the accusers, Barr.Agholor. I'll send you a document I'm preparing reflecting our discussion. He says the accusers are ready to withdraw and are requesting 5m naira. I've stated that if they're asking for money to cover legals fees they've spent prior to being informed of my innocence then I can consider it. I've stated that a withdrawal is a condition to renumeration of money they've spent trying to prosecute me wrongly. He proposes several complex solutions but I've stated Barr.Francis would work with him to see actualization of the matter being closed. The Chief Judge has received notice from me to kindly see attention to the matter. Barr.Agholor and the prison in-charge indicate she is involved in these efforts.

I'm trusting Barr.Francis follows up with the discussion and I'll send the document here for your review.

7/4/23, 12:40 PM - W: Good morning.

7/4/23, 12:41 PM - Barr Francis: It's ok. I'll be with him in Asaba tomorrow and the IPO as well

withdrawal request response acknowledgent.pdf

7/4/23, 1:08 PM - W: Review and advise.

7/4/23, 1:10 PM - P.D: Have you sent this yet?



If at all it should be coming from your lawyer and not you writing to them personally, my thoughts

7/4/23, 1:10 PM - W: This is for barr.francis advise.

7/4/23, 1:11 PM - W: This reflect our verbal discussion. Barr.francis will discuss further but I'm highlighting the conditions for my acceptance of his proposal. There are some contradicting approaches which I've asked he ensure are compatible with my lawyers.

7/4/23, 1:11 PM - W: This document advises what is expected. A withdrawal. not partial withdrawal or procedural but closure of the matter.

7/4/23, 1:13 PM - Barr Francis: I'll go through it

7/4/23, 1:13 PM - P.D: Ok

7/4/23, 1:13 PM - W: Okay.

7/5/23, 1:56 PM - Barr Francis: I'm in Asaba now. Headed to State CID

7/5/23, 1:57 PM - P.D: 👍

7/5/23, 2:14 PM - W: Welcome.

7/5/23, 2:56 PM - Barr Francis: At State CID now.

7/6/23, 4:58 PM - W: Met Barr.Francis with the in charge.

He mutters those random words other do in Agbor prison and Agbor.

Specifically associated with the groups that have making an effort to disturb me.

Specifically "you're out fool", "I've missed you".

Some random utterances. I told barr.francis that he is here by pastor request. He should not reflect any association to any group but do what he was engaged for.

7/6/23, 4:59 PM - W: If this will be a problem, I'm giving notice to Pastor so he can review and advise on your capacity.

I've met many lawyers and some have outrightly done wrong.

7/6/23, 5:03 PM - Barr Francis: When were these utterances made and by whom?

7/6/23, 5:08 PM - P.D: Emmanuel I don’t seem to understand your statements above , I suggest you relax and allow him do his work, we are hopeful that this will be a lasting solution.

7/6/23, 5:14 PM - P.D: Patience is all that’s required…. Be patient…. Your Attorney is your best plug and bringing this issue to a close is also for his benefit and carrier , so relax and let’s watch things play out for our good…. All you need is PATIENCE

7/6/23, 6:21 PM - W: You. That's why I stated that if you're acting like others seem to be, act for pastors sake not yours. I don't know you or why you'd make funny utterances which is something I complain and reflects persons that eventually act negatively.

7/6/23, 6:22 PM - W: It is a complaint, against persons accusing me and police. It's also a prospect of working towards a withdrawal. At court I'd prove my innocence and status as a victim.

7/6/23, 6:22 PM - W: It's not a murder where I'm searching for desperate solutions.

7/6/23, 6:40 PM - W: Barr.Francis, do you have the case file ?.

Did you meet with Barr.agholor ?

7/6/23, 6:41 PM - Barr Francis: I got the case file from him.

7/6/23, 6:41 PM - W: Have you engaged the court ?. I need the latest copy of the case file.

7/6/23, 6:41 PM - Barr Francis: He made copies and gave to me.

7/6/23, 6:41 PM - W: Barr.agholor is not my lawyer Barr.francis.

7/6/23, 6:42 PM - W: He represents the people accusing me.

7/6/23, 6:43 PM - Barr Francis: Did I not tell you I was going to meet with him concerning his proposal?

7/6/23, 6:43 PM - W: I sent you a document showing current state of things. I need the latest version of the case file from Umunede high court.

7/6/23, 6:44 PM - W: The copy he presented to you, does it contain the minutes of the last court seating ?.

7/7/23, 5:45 PM - W: Barr.Francis, I need a copy of the case file you received and feedback from your discussion with Barr.Agholor.

7/7/23, 5:45 PM - W: Does the casefile contain the latest minutes from Umunede high court ?.

7/7/23, 6:34 PM - P.D: I guess he is on the move , he will respond soon

7/7/23, 6:36 PM - Barr Francis: Good evening, he didn't give it to me as a soft copy. I'll have to sort it and snap it page by page and send. Minutes of last court sitting isn't there but he told me what transpired on the last adjourned date. PW1 is still testifying and the sitting judge is currently at the Election tribunal.

7/7/23, 6:38 PM - Barr Francis: As for my discussion with him, he said the family aren't willing to withdraw but he may indulge us if we file bail application so you can come out and then he'd see how he can prevail on the family to withdraw. I asked for the number of a principal member of the family he declined.

7/7/23, 6:39 PM - W: I'd like a digital copy. Scan or snap kindly.

7/7/23, 6:40 PM - W: He informed me they're withdrawing, if he says otherwise we're petitioning and defending. If you're capable I'd indulge your counsel otherwise I'd seek another.

7/7/23, 6:40 PM - Barr Francis: I was at the ministry of Justice today as well. Been there since afternoon. Discussed with the dpp and he said they can't withdraw except the family withdraws.

7/7/23, 6:40 PM - W: The DPP is not asked to withdraw, they're presented evidence which I've provided to you.

7/7/23, 6:41 PM - W: Would you ask the DPP withdraw without evidence and witnesses showing its a ridiculous charge ?

7/7/23, 6:41 PM - Barr Francis: PTT-20230707-WA0002.opus (file attached)

7/7/23, 6:42 PM - W: It's factual. If you're unable to attend as I've instructed why would I retain you. You're engaging the DPP with a withdrawal request of evidence showing the charge is ridiculous ?

7/7/23, 6:42 PM - W: I'll call you on phone.

7/7/23, 6:43 PM - Barr Francis: I'll be expecting your call.

7/7/23, 6:44 PM - P.D: Emmanuel , pls there is no lawyer on earth you would indulge that would act like a magician on this , would you give him time and the benefit of doubt to handle this pls

7/7/23, 6:46 PM - P.D: I brought him in cos I trust his abilities and am confident it will be resolved only if you will just trust someone…..

7/7/23, 6:49 PM - W: I'm relieving the lawyer he's not okay. I de talk to am he say "he staff you", madness de worry barr.francis.

7/7/23, 6:49 PM - You removed Barr Francis

7/7/23, 6:50 PM - W: I don remove am from the group.
