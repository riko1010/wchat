I've planned to, and I will call the SAN. My intent is to present clear and consice facts and emphasize the challenges with family that I indicated at the beginning. That he act on the fact I'm a victim and have suspects before, during and after the incident I'm wrongly accused. The lawyer to the accusers have indicated willingness to withdraw after presenting the documents I'll be sending to Katu again. They asked 5m naira. I'm yet to engage and conclude. I've made other efforts. I'm okay.

8/2/23, 2:40 PM - W: You can see the chats with my father where I'm arguing he's abusive by imposing requests while refusing to act on my release. The police and persons involved are available to him but he's been unactionable. I recently gave him 100k to get the police I reported to on February 12, 2022, to Asaba to give a statement to the IPOs so it'd insists the MOJ drop the case.

8/2/23, 2:40 PM - W: He refused.
