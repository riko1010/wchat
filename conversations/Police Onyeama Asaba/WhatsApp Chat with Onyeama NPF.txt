facts and evidences v3.3 (1).pdf

5/2/23, 8:10 PM - W: This version 3.3 lists suspects and indicates the situation to be a robbery and assassination. Kindly review and advise.

5/3/23, 8:29 AM - W: Have you reviewed the document I sent.

You are required to withdraw the charge when I prove the person claimed to be dead on April 19, 2022, is suspected attacker. You don't know what occured on April 19, 2022, the statement you presented was not written by me or with information I provided.

I have presented the list of suspects in the last document I sent to you. If you don't act on it you are detaining a victim unlawfully. The witnesses on April 19, 2022, inside my gated premises are me and my staff, she is named Happy. I will call shortly to discuss and conclude.

Good morning.

5/3/23, 8:31 AM - Onyeama NPF: Noted

5/3/23, 8:33 AM - W: Important you review the last document sent, v3.3, I did not list suspects in previous versions. You should also expect to speak to witnesses involved in this matter today. The only witness I brought to Asaba in your custody was a random stranger who helped after the attack. I personally brought that witness to you at Asaba.

5/3/23, 8:53 AM - W: Confirm you have or will prior to my call. I've been detained for a year+ after suffering an attack at my gated premises. The laws of the country absolves me from nay accusation during a threat to my life and my property.

5/3/23, 9:56 AM - W: I'll call soon. The arguments I sent refers to laws of Nigeria. Same laws you used in charging me wrongly for a crime. Read the document and confirm readiness to speak with relevant persons and act on this matter. Its not an issue of helping but acting in accordance to the job you're doing as a police officer. Every fact presented is verifiable.

5/3/23, 6:42 PM - W: Good evening.

5/3/23, 8:59 PM - Onyeama NPF: Emma good evening

5/3/23, 9:02 PM - W: I'm okay. I planned to call but if you've got feedback I'm receptive. I got a cross to Blessing, asked she be kind enough to involve and review the facts towards my release.

5/3/23, 9:05 PM - Onyeama NPF: She is aware of the actions being taken. Most times I don't involve her due to her activities or other assignments

5/3/23, 9:06 PM - Onyeama NPF: All the same, I still mounting pressure on DPP legal department for necessary actions

5/3/23, 9:08 PM - W: If you've investigated the facts presented and find them true, the law indicates the absence of criminal accusation at me. I would rather be the complainant which I am.

5/3/23, 9:08 PM - Onyeama NPF: I suppose to be there tomorrow but am travelling  for autopsy at Warri General Hospital

5/3/23, 9:08 PM - W: Safe travels.

5/3/23, 9:09 PM - Onyeama NPF: I see the way you look at issues from legal perspectives

5/3/23, 9:09 PM - Onyeama NPF: Thanks so much

5/3/23, 9:09 PM - W: My staff, the other victim of the attack is available to present her account of the events on April 19, 2022.

5/3/23, 9:10 PM - W: There's only legal perspectives otherwise the remand and detainment would be a kidnapping.

5/3/23, 9:10 PM - W: At police it's the law you operate with, same with the court.

5/3/23, 9:11 PM - Onyeama NPF: What you are saying is the fact

5/3/23, 9:11 PM - Onyeama NPF: There is hope of convincing them to reality of this case.

5/3/23, 9:11 PM - W: You're required to act on my immediate release. It's not convincing, it's quoting law.

5/3/23, 9:12 PM - W: At police and court, the law either absolves or indicts. The applicable laws shows when I'm the victim I should not be treated as a suspect.

5/3/23, 9:12 PM - W: You wrote a report based on claims that were not presented to you by me.

5/3/23, 9:13 PM - W: The claims presented in these documents show I reported and invited police on February 12, 2022, further armed attacks occurred.

5/3/23, 9:13 PM - W: On April 19, 2022, another attack occurred.

5/3/23, 9:14 PM - W: While in your custody, another attack occurred.

5/3/23, 9:14 PM - W: What is there to convince, at trial presenting facts closes the matter. The thing is to verify, not to convince.

5/4/23, 10:24 AM - W: Good morning, I'll call today so we continue on our discussions. If you'll be out of the office you can let me know when, later today or tomorrow ?

5/4/23, 10:24 AM - W: Safe travels.

5/7/23, 9:33 PM - W: You've not responded to my recent notices. What's the status of things ?.

5/8/23, 2:40 AM - Onyeama NPF: I have not responded bcos, I have not gotten concrete and positive response from DPP or Ministry of Justice

5/8/23, 2:41 AM - Onyeama NPF: I will be there this morning

5/8/23, 2:42 AM - Onyeama NPF: I will be in their office b4 10am this morning

5/8/23, 8:27 AM - W: I've sent facts to be admitted in your report, listed witnesses to support my claims and evidences. This action should ensure the MOJ take immediate action on the matter. Good morning. I will call today.

5/8/23, 8:53 AM - W: The state counsel in the matter is Barr.F.O. Isichie. I can send you his contact so you inform him what you've verified to be factual. He could be of assistance but has not acted on the facts presented which I would compel with a request to the court. You could discuss with him on your efforts or investigations so he is of positive assistance in resolving this unnecessary charge before the court. Should I send his number to you ?.

5/8/23, 12:06 PM - Onyeama NPF: You are free to send

5/8/23, 12:07 PM - W: Alright. I'll notify him alongside.

5/8/23, 12:10 PM - W: Barr.Isichie.vcf (file attached)

5/8/23, 12:11 PM - W: I just spoke to him. I've insisted he represent the state interest by being fair, not claiming he represents the complainant. Alternatively I've asked he involve and expedite the closure of this matter if his advise is focused on resolution when I've presented information to show I'm the victim.

5/8/23, 12:12 PM - W: He advises and insists a peaceful settlement is his position. The laws insists he act on evidence and law, not just defending the interests of persons who claim to be complainants.

5/8/23, 12:15 PM - W: What is the procedure to establish a complaint. My lawyers are currently working on it. Do you receive and act on complaints directly ?.

5/8/23, 12:18 PM - Onyeama NPF: I understand

5/24/23, 2:05 PM - Onyeama NPF: I need your approval if you wish. Again I will want to know the lawyer to enable me work with the lawyer quickly

5/25/23, 9:27 AM - W: Good morning

5/25/23, 9:28 AM - Onyeama NPF: Yes, good morning

5/25/23, 9:28 AM - Onyeama NPF: We discussed well

5/25/23, 9:28 AM - W: I'll call.

5/25/23, 9:28 AM - Onyeama NPF: Like what I told you, allow us to work

5/25/23, 9:29 AM - Onyeama NPF: We equally discussed with Aghulor

5/25/23, 9:29 AM - W: You're taking action in a matter where I'm accused. I'll call and listen to what you propose to resolve this unjust accusation.

5/27/23, 5:16 PM - W: I met with my lawyer, Barr.Osifo, I've signed copies of the facts. I'm asking you assist to avoid a case of prosecution for your falsification of statement and other complaints against you and blessing. Kindly assist.

Its the minimum you can do to resolve this issue. He'll meet and engage you for advise and action, there are suspects stated, if you've reviewed the matter I can provide info to make arrest and investigation.

5/30/23, 7:46 PM - Your security code with Onyeama NPF changed. Tap to learn more.

5/30/23, 8:03 PM - Your security code with Onyeama NPF changed. Tap to learn more.

7/7/23, 7:35 PM - W: I sent a new lawyer to engage you in resolution and withdrawal. I've insisted you're required to withdraw the accusations if I'm innocent and a victim. The current lawyer behaves like the other lawyers.

He literally said "I've missed you". I don't know why a lawyer I've barely met will miss me and then inform me that barr.agholor whom indicated he's ready alongside the accusers to withdraw would state otherwise.

I've asked him to disengage from the matter like Barr.osifo who seems to be closely aligned with inspector blessing.

7/7/23, 7:36 PM - W: I'll call for further engagement and receipt of your advise on how we can speedily resolve this. I've asked you act fair otherwise I'd have to complain that you are oppressing me as a police officer. Be kind enough to act on evidence after verification than malice.

7/7/23, 7:36 PM - W: Good evening.

7/7/23, 10:02 PM - Onyeama NPF: Emma, I can't oppress you

7/7/23, 10:05 PM - Onyeama NPF: You don't know what I'm passing thru as a result of this case

7/7/23, 10:05 PM - Onyeama NPF: You feel I was the way that charged you to court

7/7/23, 10:06 PM - Onyeama NPF: Ask your lawyer who signed the investigation report in the file

7/7/23, 10:07 PM - Onyeama NPF: You went to court on the directive of my authority

7/8/23, 6:50 AM - W: Good morning.

I am complaining the statement you and blessing are responsible for writing and presenting is not mine, does not contain anything related to my verbal dictation of the events that occured. That is my complaint not the fact that I was brought before court. I was charged using a statement falsified by you and blessing. That is a valid complaint.

7/8/23, 6:51 AM - W: I am asking that the falsified statement be redacted and the actual facts be admitted. The lawyer I sent to you recently is not okay. I'll ask my lawyers to follow-up the matter. He was recommended by someone on an emergency basis.

7/8/23, 8:08 AM - Onyeama NPF: I came to Agbor to see you in respect of this statement, you refused to see me

7/8/23, 8:09 AM - Onyeama NPF: I have been trying my best but you won't understand the challenges I'm facing here. Why you are there is not bcos of your statement.

7/8/23, 8:11 AM - Onyeama NPF: I even expect you to deny the statement if it doesn't represent what happened and tell the court the truth  of what you know.

7/8/23, 8:13 AM - Onyeama NPF: I was told by DPP that it lies in your lawyer to withdraw the case.  I can't go to court and withdraw it at this stage

7/8/23, 8:14 AM - Onyeama NPF: I have discussed with one of your lawyers on how to go about it and he agrees.

7/8/23, 8:26 AM - W: I'm yet to present my case at court. The lawyers I've engaged continually do wrong. There are persons I've caught engaging my lawyers without permission to sabotage and misinform them. I'm detained so I'm limited by how I can manage the engagements to prevent corruption of my lawyers.

7/8/23, 8:28 AM - W: I've relieved the lawyers including the recent lawyer, Barr.Francis. I'll engage others and ask they collaborate with you if you accept to acknowledge my statement you collected is untrue and support efforts to investigate the persons attacking me, including the attack while I was in your custody.

Petitions are planned towards my complaints.

7/8/23, 8:29 AM - W: DPP works with information you provide. I've provided you facts showing that the report you submitted to DPP does not represent the truth. I did not admit to an accidental discharge.

7/8/23, 8:30 AM - W: I asked if you were ready to take my statement. You said "no". That is why I refused to engage you on your visit. I was not interested in verbal conversations without giving a statement when we already had this conflict at Asaba. You and blessing stated the falsified statement was already tendered to your superior officers which made no sense. You can't work with a statement you created yourself and use it to charge me to court.

7/8/23, 8:31 AM - W: I may not have provided you the latest update on discussions with barr.agholor.

Here's the document representing the conclusion.

7/8/23, 8:31 AM - W: DOC-20230704-WA0000.pdf (file attached)

withdrawal request response acknowledgent.pdf

7/8/23, 8:32 AM - W: My complaint that the statement is not mine compels you to act towards my vindication and release. If you don't support the efforts you'd be found criminally liable for the time I've spent in prison and the wrong charge of murder against me. There's still still for you to do right. I encourage you take it as a personal responsibility to remedy the wrong you've done to me.
